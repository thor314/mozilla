Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a.

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":3222,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1829,"reviewCount":1058,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1690275298000},{"id":"newtaboverride@agenedia.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/626/626810-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/626/626810-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/626/626810-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"New Tab Override","version":"15.1.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3782413/new_tab_override-15.1.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.soeren-hentzschel.at/firefox-webextensions/new-tab-override/","supportURL":"https://github.com/cadeyrn/newtaboverride/issues","description":"New Tab Override allows you to set the page that shows whenever you open a new tab.","fullDescription":"New Tab Override allows you to set the page that shows whenever you open a new tab.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Change your new tab page to whatever website you like\n    Use your current home page as new tab page\n    Customize the background color for your new tab page\n    Store a local HTML file in the extension and use it for new tab content\n    Get the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page (German language only)\n    You can set the focus to the address bar or the website\n    Customize where new tabs are opened\n    Automatically adds “http://” if protocol is missing from a URL\n    Can be used in conjunction with Firefox’s container tabs feature\n    Dark mode support for options interface\n\n\nShortcuts\n\nThe settings interface can be accessed via Shift + F12.

New Tab Override will not work without the following permissions:\n\n- access browser history\n\nThe permission to access the browser history is needed to prevent spammy \"moz-extension://\" entries in your browsing history every time you open a new tab. There is no way to prevent this without this permission.\n\n- access browser tabs\n\nThe permission to access the browser tabs is needed so that New Tab Override can jump to the settings page if it’s already open in another tab when you click the button to open the extension’s settings.\n\n- read and modify browser settings\n\nThe permission to read and modify browser settings is needed to change the position of new tabs and for the option to automatically use your home page as new tab page.\n\nOptional permissions. These permissions are not needed to install and use New Tab Override:\n\n- access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at\n\nThe permission to access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at is only needed if you enable the option to see the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page. If enabled, New Tab Override reads the feed of www.soeren-hentzschel.at to show you the latest news.\n\nSilent permissions. New Tab Override requires additional permissions, but Firefox does not prompt requests for the following:\n\n- menus\n\nThe menus permission is needed for providing an entry in the tools menu for accessing New Tab Override's settings.\n\n- storage\n\nThe storage permission is needed so that New Tab Override can store settings such as your new tab page.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe extension requires at least Firefox 78.

This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme .

This hides them only, and enables hotkey support.","weeklyDownloads":3,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Noitidart","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5457039/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/Noitidart?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":3,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/container-hotkeys/reviews/","updateDate":1544136607000},{"id":"{490580e6-3cfc-4309-9fcd-ad15a2501c6b}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Pale Night","version":"2.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/2797899/pale_night-2.0.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"A dark theme made to match my GTK desktop theme","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":0,"type":"theme","creator":{"name":"Matt","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13156028/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2576/2576421.png?modified=1557794879","width":680,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2576/2576421.png?modified=1557794879","thumbnailWidth":473,"thumbnailHeight":64},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2576/2576475.png?modified=1616435485","width":720,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2576/2576475.jpg?modified=1616435485","thumbnailWidth":720,"thumbnailHeight":92}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":0,"reviewCount":0,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pale-night/reviews/","updateDate":1557776800000}]}
